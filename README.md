# 🤖 AI with Python – Script Series

Welcome to the official repository for the **“AI with Python”** series – a practical and beginner-friendly collection of Python scripts shared weekly on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/python_scripts/).

## 📌 What Is This?

This repo is designed to help you:
- Learn core concepts of **AI, machine learning**, and **data preprocessing**
- Write clean, understandable Python code
- Apply what you learn in real-world problems

Each script is written with **detailed comments**, made to be run in **Jupyter Notebook**, and aligned with a specific AI/ML concept.
